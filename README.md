### Energy Futures Forecasting Project
# Project Overview
This project develops a forecasting model for energy futures prices by combining market data, trading positions, and company fundamentals. Using advanced time series analysis (ARIMA/SARIMA) alongside market context metrics, the project aims to predict price movements and identify significant market patterns.

# Key Objectives

- Develop accurate price forecasting models for energy futures
- Integrate multiple data sources (ICE/CME, CFTC, SEC 10-K) for comprehensive analysis
- Create interactive visualizations for price predictions and market context
- Implement a complete data pipeline from collection to visualization

# Technical Implementation

- Data Collection: Gathering futures prices, trading positions, and company data from ICE/CME, CFTC, and SEC sources
- Database Setup: Implementing SQL database and Databricks processing environment
